# CLAUDE.md — mundial-build

## Scope rule

**Stay in this repo.** Pipeline work, data commits, and submodule pointer updates for `mundial-data` all live here. When changes in another repo are needed (e.g., `mundial` or `mundial-server`), write a clear prompt for a separate Claude session scoped to that repo — do not edit those repos directly from here.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/` | Data pipeline scripts, source CSVs, `countries.json` (build input), and `country_aliases.json`/`country_registry.py` (canonical country-identity resolution). See [`pipeline/CLAUDE.md`](pipeline/CLAUDE.md) for the build sequence and pipeline-specific rules. |
| `data/` | Git submodule → [mundial-data](https://github.com/born-in-plays-for/mundial-data) — core frontend assets only |
| `extras/` | Supplementary data not consumed by the main map (`wc2026_gdp.json`, `wc2026_gdp_pc_ppp.json`, `wc2026_hdi.json`) |
| `pages/` | Self-contained HTML pages hosted from this repo (`wc2026_correlation.html`) |
| `infographics/` | Infographic HTML sources |

### `data/` submodule — what belongs there

Only files consumed directly by the `mundial` frontend belong in the submodule:
`elo_rank.json`, `elo_history.json`, `r32_teams.json`, `uk-nations.geojson`, and the
pid-keyed `v2/` files (`v2/map.json`, `v2/live.json`, `v2/status.json`,
`v2/wiki_en.json`/`wiki_fr.json`/`wiki_de.json`/`wiki_it.json`/`wiki_es.json`) — see
`pipeline/README.md`'s "Relational model" section for how these are built.
`v2/status.json` carries **eliminated teams only** (`{iso2: {round, date?}}`)
— a team absent from it is still alive.

`countries.json` is a pipeline build input — it lives in `pipeline/`, not in the submodule.
GDP/HDI extras live in `extras/` and are fetched only by `pages/wc2026_correlation.html`.

The older `map_data.json`, `player_wiki.json`, and non-`v2` `wiki_<lang>.json` files are
**pipeline-internal intermediates now, not frontend-facing** — the frontend migrated to
`v2/` in July 2026. They live in `pipeline/`, not the submodule, and are committed there
(not gitignored) because producing them hits live external APIs (Wikipedia, api-football)
and isn't cheap to redo casually — same reasoning as the committed `wc2026_players.csv`.
